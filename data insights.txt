include column average_balance - ok


drop reward_cash back - see if can we 
drop credit_cards held
merge in groups based in income_level and credit_rating - ok - ask if it's ok
* drop household sizes or homes_owned, check if own_your_home it's okay to keep it.
drop accounts_open: we didnt find any strong realtions on tableau and SQL

ask if it's better to choose average_balance or the quarters columns
the q3 column has a nice relation

deal with outliers:
- q1_balance 1 client with 3450.
	- is it good to drop him or can we keep him?
	- he didnt accepted the offer. 
	- High income and credit rating

all of quarters columns outliers didn't accept the offer.
most of them are high income and high or medium credit rating.

We did the plots on python and check on sql the values.
