## Scenario
You are working as a risk analyst with a bank. The bank provides credit card services and wants to understand the demographics and other characteristics of its customers that accept a credit card offer and that do not accept a credit card.

## Objective
* Build a model to predict which customers are likely to accept an offer.
* Identify the demographics and charateristics which most influence whether a credit card offer is accepted or rejected.

## Tools and methods

### Trello - using agile method (Kanban)

### Github

### MySQL

### [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/angela6850/viz/FCdataclassification/Dashboard?publish=yes)
* Visualize and deep dive in the data to find customer behaviour patterns

### [Python](https://www.python.org/)
* #### Deal with nulls, check duplicates and drop useless columns
* #### EDA - review columns' distribution, counts and correlation
* #### Visualizations - Matplotlib and Seaborn to check if there are outliers
* #### Pre-processing: encode categories and scale numerics

* #### Train, test, split

* #### Define model
  Logistic regression classify
* #### Check accuracy of our classification model
* #### Fit the model to more balanced data
* #### Resampling techniques confusion_matrix and heatmap
* #### Correlating categories
  Random Under Sampler and Random Over Sampler
* #### AUC

### Model Result
Use different models to compare the accuracies and find the model that best fits your data. You can use the measures of accuracies that have been discussed in class. Please note that while comparing different models, make sure you use the same measure of accuracy as a benchmark.
